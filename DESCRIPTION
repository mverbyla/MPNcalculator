Description: This package calculates the most probable number (MPN) associated with
    results from an IDEXX Quanti-Tray 2000 analysis (Colilert, Enterolert, etc.). 
    In addition to providing the MPN, the package also calculates the 95% confidence 
    interval of the MPN and a probability score that indicates the likelihood of the 
    experimental outcome obtained.
